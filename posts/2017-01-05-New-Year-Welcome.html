    <p class="teaser">Finally getting a chance to get some writing done, so hopefully you find some 
        helpful information here as the posts begin to trickle out. As with any piece of writing, 
        perspective matters, and this past year has been filled with not just one, but many different 
        perspectives.</p>

    <p>Most notably, 2016 marked my first year at Microsoft. This has already been an incredible journey,
        and I can only imagine what the future holds. I am incredibly honored to be part of the mobile first, 
        cloud first journey that Microsoft is on, and it is truly amazing to see the things that customers are
        doing with our platform. There is an amazing selection of tools and services to leverage, allowing 
        endless opportunity to transform even the most legacy business into a modern powerhouse.</p>

        "Digital Transformation", the basic idea is the digitization of current business processes in order to 
        enable companies to engage thier customers, empower thier employees, optimize their business, and transform the 
        products and services they offer. To capture this model visually, you will typically see images like the following:</p>

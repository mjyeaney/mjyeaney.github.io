    <p class="teaser">A common issue encountered when working with teams is how to expose Azure Resource Manager tag values in Log Analytics queries?  While this feature isn’t quite available yet, I’ll show you how to leverage serverless offerings (including Logic Apps and Functions) to pull this data into your queries.  This data can then be used to create tag-driven alerts or augment queries with tag information that may have been previously unavailable.</p>

    <p>In the following example, we’ll be pulling tags for virtual machines only, but this approach can be easily modified to support any type of Azure resource needed.</p>

    <h3>Solution Design</h3>

    <p>The basic outline of the solution is shown below. Here we are using a Logic App to poll and pull Azure resources every 15 minutes, extracting tag information and inserting this data into OMS using the HTTP Data Collector API.</p>

    <p>Let’s now break down each piece of this architecture and see what’s involved in created your own serverless solution.</p>

    <h3>Logic App</h3>

    <p>The heart of the Logic Apps workflow is a schedule-driven trigger that lists all Azure resources every 15 minutes. This is straightforward, and makes up the first 2 steps of our workflow:</p>

    <p>Next, we’ll iterate over each of these resources and look for resources that are virtual machines. Note that (by default) For-Each loops in Logic Apps run in parallel, so we are getting some extra efficiency goodness by letting the platform manage and schedule this work for us. </p>

    <p>Note that we’re simply filtering on the resource type of “Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines” to make sure we’re only working with VM’s; you could change this to look for any resource needed.</p>

    <p>Finally, we’ll call an Azure Function to help us insert this data into OMS leveraging the HTTP Data Collector API. Calling an Azure Function from Logic Apps is straightforward, and only requires us to specify the payload we want to send.</p>

    <p>In this case, I’m simply grabbing the “Tag” JSON from the resource description. However, note that I’m adding a runtime property named “VmName” to this structure so that OMS know what VM these tags belong to. While this expression may look a bit tedious, this is straightforward to setup in Logic Apps using the Expression editor.</p>

    <h3>Function App</h3>

    <p>The Function app handles the single task of inserting a JSON payload into OMS. This requires some standard code to build up a HMAC signature in order to correctly authenticate our POST call to insert data. The full code for the function is listed below:</p>

    <h3>Log Analytics Queries</h3>

    <p>Now that we have the data in Log Analytics, we are ready to query it and make use of it. As we can see from the above apps, we are capturing every tag value along with the VM name associated with the tags. Noting the special naming that Log Analytics uses for custom data collection (notably, appending “_CL” after the table name), we can query for the most recent tag values for each VM using the following query syntax:</p>

    <p>In this query, we are specifically looking for all “Cost Center” tags, and viewing them for each recorded VM. The result table looks like the following example:</p>

    <h2>CloudTimeCheck: Visualize Time Differences</h2>
    
    <p>Keeping accurate time between computers on a network is a notorously hard
        problem, yet it's also one many of us simply don't think about on a day-to-day basis.
        However, time-keeping is such a fundamental concept to many things we use such computers for, 
        that when things go wrong, they can get <em>really strange</em>.</p>
        
    <p>Yet, many language / frameworks provide no acknowledgement that time may be nothing more than
        and illusion. For example, the .NET method DateTime.UtcNow gives the illusion that no matter 
        where your are (geographically) or what computer you are using, you will get the exact time 
        in UTC format.</p> 
        
    <p>So what can we do? Measure. That's why I built CloudTimeCheck: to visualize how bad/etc things are...</p>
    
    <h3>CloudTimeCheck</h3>
    
    <p>CloudTimeCheck is a web application built on NodeJS, running on Windows Azure. It runs a set of tests 
        that estimate the time differences between the client (browser), web server, and the Azure Storage fabric.</p>

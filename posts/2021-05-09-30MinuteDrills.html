        Often times I find myself (as many of us do) "paralyzed" by the myriad of ways in which to solve a 
        particular problem. This is generally because I start thinking of all the ways a given approach 
        could go wrong, and end up focusing on what won't work instead of the MVP-style approach of what will work. 
        In this post, I want to share a method I've been using to help break through these blockers and help myself get to
        a "version 1" deliverable.

    <h3>A Question of Time</h3>

    <p>
        The main idea here is to restrict our ability to paint magical worlds of perfectionism. To do this, I choose 
        to restrict the time I give myself to develop a "V1" solution approach. As the title suggests, I give myself 
        30 mintues <i>maximum</i> to come up with a design. While that may sound entirely too limiting, there are some
        benefits that can really help to push design ideas out of my head:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Focusing on one key desired outcomes ONLY - helps avoid feature creep.</li>
        <li>Write down every known tradeoff and promptly forget about it - helps to relive the burdon of creating a "less than perfect" creation.</li>
        <li>Keep a minimalist approach - that is, what is the <i>bare minimum</i> thing you could do to achieve the previously stated goals?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        That's it - short and sweet (and intentionally so). And while I'm positive this isn't necessarly new to some of you, 
        I have found it tremendously helpful when I'm approaching a solution space for the first time. To that end, I would love to hear 
        what other ways you have to help focus and breakthrough the "Analysis Paralysis" phases - let me know in the comments!
